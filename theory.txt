Write once run anywhere

oak - java green - java coffee

Methods - performs a task when called

Classes - Used to organize code/ blueprint..

Robust 
It has Garbage collector feature
it is platform independent
Compilation happens in byte code
Multi threadinghelps with multi tasking
It is a portable language 
Java is not as fast as c , c++
But gives good performance than others

OOPS: 
Abstraction, 
Encapsulation, 
Inheritance, 
Ploymorphism - Same methods fordifferent tasks

Primitive datatypes: by default supported by java
1. byte -128 to 127
2. short -32768 32767
3. int -2^31 to 2^31-1
4. long  -2^63 to 2^63 -1
5. float -32 bit decimals
6. double -64 bit decimals
7. boolean -true | false
8. char 16 - bit unicode character representation.. unicode representation can be represented across the world
        in different character encodings

Non Primitive Data types: Developer has liberty to define non primitive data types nature
1. String (Special datatype , not fully primitive ornot fully non-primitive)
    String str="Nishant";
2.Array - A ds which can store a sequence of homogeneous data types
    System.out.println(arr) //prints the memory location
Array is a zero index based datatype.

Java Tokens:
Reserved word ,key words
Keywords:
abstract, boolean,  super, switch, new, while, this, throw, final

Identifiers:
any variable names  you declare in your program 
cannot start with number, contain space, have + , -, &

Constants : value cannot be changes once declared
final int i =5

Special Symbols:
    [] () {}, ; * =

Operators:
    arithmatic ,comparison, logical, bitwise etc.


DataType conversion:
    `int` can easly fit to `long`
    `long` to fit into `int`,something special needs to be done.

Package:
Grouping multiple related Java files like cart package, 

Class: Blue print to create an object

      object - instace of the blueprint
Any class marked as public is acessible to everything in the whole project

main method : entry of Java program, it is required to execute your program.

static : whenever you want to acess something inside the class without creatingobject you need to use static 

void : return type of the method
String args[] :  Java will provide all commnad line arguments using the  string[] array.

System class - To input or output something we need this class
out - stream object
`System class` uses `out stream` object to print something.

Arrays in JAVA:
Array is a container which can store a sequence of values in continuos fashion
